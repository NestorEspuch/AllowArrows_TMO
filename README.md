# AllowArrows_TMO
Simple script that allows you to use the keyboard arrows, left to go to the previous chapter and right to go to the next chapter, on the well-known website https://lectortmo.com/.

To complement its use and have the script automatically injected when starting the web, I personally use a Chrome extension called 'User JavaScript and CSS'.

The script is made without any profit motive, I simply want to share it, since as a frequent user it has been of great convenience to me.
